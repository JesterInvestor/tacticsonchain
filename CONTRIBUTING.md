## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules (`npm run lint`)
- Use functional React components
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
export function GameBoard({ players }: GameBoardProps) {
  const [activePlayer, setActivePlayer] = useState(0);
  // ...
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
export default function GameBoard(props: any) {
  var player = 0;
  // ...
}
```

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # Reusable React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/       # Smart contracts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** `kebab-case.tsx` (e.g., `connect-button.tsx`)
- **Components:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `ConnectButton`)
- **Functions:** `camelCase` (e.g., `handleConnect`)
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`)

### Smart Contracts

When modifying smart contracts:

1. Test thoroughly on testnet
2. Include gas optimization notes
3. Document all functions
4. Add events for important state changes
5. Consider security implications

### Testing

Currently, we don't have automated tests, but:

- Manually test all changes
- Test on multiple browsers
- Test wallet connections
- Test on mobile devices
- Document test scenarios in PR
