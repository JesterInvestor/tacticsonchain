Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to adapt your [JesterInvestor/tacticsonchain](https://github.com/JesterInvestor/tacticsonchain) game for the **Ronin blockchain**:

---

## 1. **Understand Ronin Blockchain Basics**
- Learn about Ronin’s wallet, NFT standards (ERC-721/ERC-1155), and smart contract deployment.
- Review official [Ronin documentation](https://docs.roninchain.com/) for SDKs and API usage.

---

## 2. **Set Up Ronin Developer Environment**
- Create a Ronin developer account.
- Install Ronin wallet browser extension for local testing.
- Clone your repo locally:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/JesterInvestor/tacticsonchain.git
  ```

---

## 3. **Design Blockchain Asset Structure**
- Decide which game assets will be on-chain (units, cosmetics, membership).
- Plan NFT metadata (e.g., unit type, abilities, rarity).

---

## 4. **Write Smart Contracts**
- Use **Solidity** to create:
  - **Unit NFT Contracts** (ERC-721/ERC-1155)
  - **Membership Contracts** (special NFTs/tokens)
  - **Marketplace Contracts** (for trading units)
- Test contracts locally with Hardhat or Truffle.

---

## 5. **Deploy Contracts to Ronin Testnet**
- Use Ronin’s deployment tools or compatible frameworks.
- Make sure contracts are compatible with Ronin’s standards.

---

## 6. **Integrate Ronin Wallet to Next.js Frontend**
- Add wallet connect button (using Ronin Wallet SDK).
- Allow users to log in, display their NFTs, and show wallet address.

---

## 7. **Connect Game Logic with Blockchain**
- Refactor selection and inventory screens to fetch owned units from the blockchain.
- Only allow use of units the wallet owns.
- Sync game state (e.g., rewards, new NFTs) with on-chain data.

---

## 8. **Implement Marketplace and Trading**
- Add buy/sell/trade UI using Ronin’s APIs.
- Ensure secure smart contract calls from frontend.

---

## 9. **Reward Players On-chain**
- After a match, call smart contracts to mint NFTs or tokens to the winner.
- Optionally, log match results on-chain for transparency.

---

## 10. **Test End-to-End**
- Use Ronin testnet for complete flow: wallet connection, asset minting, gameplay, rewards, and trading.
- Fix bugs and audit smart contracts for security.

---

## 11. **Deploy to Production**
- Deploy smart contracts to Ronin mainnet.
- Update frontend to use mainnet endpoints.
- Announce and onboard users!

---

## 12. **Maintain and Expand**
- Monitor for bugs and user feedback.
- Add new units, cosmetics, events, and features as NFTs.
- Consider partnerships and regular updates to keep the community engaged.

---

### **Tips**
- Start with wallet integration and NFT minting before adding advanced features.
- Use Ronin’s sample projects and documentation for reference.
- Thoroughly test all blockchain interactions for security and reliability.

NOTE: The codebase has been updated to use Ronin mainnet settings for the frontend provider and contract configuration. See `src/components/ThirdwebProvider.tsx` and `src/lib/contracts.ts` for the values:

- Chain ID: 49429111 (Ronin mainnet)
- RPC: https://api.roninchain.com/rpc
- Explorer: https://explorer.roninchain.com

To run locally after pulling changes:

```powershell
npm install
# set .env variables (example)
setx NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID "your-client-id"
setx NEXT_PUBLIC_TACT_TOKEN_ADDRESS "0x..."
setx NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "0x..."
npm run dev
```

If you'd prefer to test against Ronin testnet instead, tell me and I can switch the values and add a small toggle to `src/lib/contracts.ts`.
