# Waypoint React Native Example

Minimal example demonstrating how to initialize the `@sky-mavis/waypoint-native` SDK and handle deep links in React Native.

Steps:

1. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in `App.tsx` with a real client ID from the Ronin Developer Console.
2. Register your redirect URI (e.g. `mydapp://`) in the Ronin Developer Console.
3. Configure native deep link handling for Android/iOS.
4. Run `npm install`, then `npx react-native start` and `npx react-native run-android` or `run-ios`.

This example is intentionally minimal â€” update it to meet your app's architecture and security requirements.
